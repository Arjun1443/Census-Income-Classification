# Census-Income-Classification
Census Income Classification This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year using the Census Income dataset. The dataset consists of various demographic and employment-related attributes.


🔍 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict income categories based on features such as age, education, occupation, and more.

📊 Models Used
Three machine learning models were implemented and compared:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest


📌 Key Steps
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and outliers.
Performed label encoding for categorical variables.
Standardized numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized income distribution across various features.
Identified correlations between attributes.
Model Training & Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
📈 Results
Logistic Regression: Baseline model with decent interpretability.
Decision Tree: Overfitting observed with deep trees.
Random Forest: Achieved the best performance with high accuracy and better generalization.
🛠 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
